## Learning jquery and ajax

The goal here is to play around with jquery and ajax to add some user interaction to a vacation website dashboard. The dashboard shows our upcoming trips and we want the user to be able to perform a few actions for each trip.

 - view the trip itinerary
 - confirm the trip
 - cancel the trip

There is a full write-up of everything, including a little bit about JSON in the [public/js/app.js](public/js/app.js) file.

## Getting Setup

 - install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) v4.x
 - in a command window go to this directory and run 'npm install'
 - then run `node server.js` and open http://localhost:8080 in a browser
